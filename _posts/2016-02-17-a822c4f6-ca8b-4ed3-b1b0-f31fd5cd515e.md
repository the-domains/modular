# Trimmings Module

## Wreath from 8 modules

The module was created from some scraps of paper that I had leftover after trimming another project. I just began to fold and then experiment with how the modules could fit together.

Later I was moving the wreath from the white background, and it began to fall apart. I then noticed that it could stand on its own by flaring the legs of one of the modules. An individual module with a 5 module structure standing.
